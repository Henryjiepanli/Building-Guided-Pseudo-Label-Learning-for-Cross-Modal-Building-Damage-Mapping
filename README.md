# Building-Guided Pseudo-Label Learning for Cross-Modal Building Damage Mapping

This repository provides the official implementation of our paper:

**[Building-Guided Pseudo-Label Learning for Cross-Modal Building Damage Mapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04941)**

We are thrilled to announce that our work **won the championship** in the [2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track 2](https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/winners-of-the-2025-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-all-weather-land-cover-and-building-damage-mapping/) on **All-Weather Land Cover and Building Damage Mapping**.

Moreover, our paper has been **accepted as an oral presentation** at the **2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)**.
